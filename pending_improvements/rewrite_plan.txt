Should have done this more generically!  Structs which have fields and parents.

Built-in types of size_t, string, bool, char.

top_adt = new Variant("AST_node", new UnaryVariantBranch("Statement"), ...); //these will be done via either inheritance or encapsulation, so nothing needs to happen here.
something like new Struct("Name", new Fields(new Field($type, "name"),...), new Parents(top_adt["Statement"])); //will create an ad-hoc ADT for "Statement" of which these are fields, hopefully.

Fields should know how to move themselves.
