Note: We've been a bit worried about how to capture types in valueland so far.  Start with an enum for all the types you "know about" at compile-time.  Keep the typecheck + basic inference within the type-only phase for ease of code; during this pase, also collect an "environment" for types that aren't in the enum.  valueland will refer to these types by index in the environment (so keep that environment consistent!) N.B. this will probably only come up in the Derecho application of this code.
