Right now we have the Union<A,B,C> class, and also the Allocator<A,B,C> class.  We should be able to combine these by introducing a new pointer type, Top, which contains a integer indicating which type it stores in addition to the standard index.  This shoudln't extend allocated_ref, because it won't know what type parameter to extend it under; similarly it shouldn't be extended by allocated_ref because it stores too much information.  So they'll probably have implicit conversion constructors to each other, but otherwise have no formal relationship.
